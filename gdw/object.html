<h2>Livin' on a Prayer</h2>
<p>By: Bon Jovi</p>

<p>Once upon a time not so long ago<br>
Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike<br>
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough<br>
Gina works the diner all day working for her man<br>
She brings home her pay, for love, for love</p>

<p>She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
We've got each other and that's a lot for love<br>
We'll give it a shot</p>

<p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>

<p>Tommy's got his six-string in hock<br>
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk<br>
So tough, it's tough<br>
Gina dreams of running away<br>
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers<br>
Baby, it's okay, someday</p>

<p>We've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
We've got each other and that's a lot for love<br>
We'll give it a shot</p>

<p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
Livin' on a prayer</p>

<p>Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not<br>
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got<br>
Woah, we're half way there<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>

<p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>

<p>Woah, we're half way there<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer<br>
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear<br>
Woah, livin' on a prayer</p>
