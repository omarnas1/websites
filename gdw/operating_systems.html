<h1>Computer Operating Systems</h1>

<h2>Basic Operating System Concepts</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Operating Systems</dt>
    <dd>-The software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.</dd>
  <dt>Batch Processing</dt>
    <dd>-The processing of previously collected jobs in a single batch.</dd>
  <dt>Timesharing</dt>
    <dd>-The operation of a computer system by several users for different operations at the same time.</dd>  
  <dt>Multitasking</dt>
    <dd>-Being able to execute more than one program or task simultaneously.</dd>
  <dt>Multiprocessing</dt>
    <dd>-The running of two or more programs or sequences of instructions simultaneously by a computer with more than one central processor.</dd>
  <dt>Computer Architecture(main components)</dt>
    <dd>-Cache</dd>
    <dd>-CPU</dd>
    <dd>-Hardware</dd>
    <dd>-Machine instruction cycle</dd>
    <dd>-Main memory</dd>
    <dd>-Network</dd>
    <dd>-Peripheral</dd>
    <dd>-Random access memory (RAM)</dd>
  <dt>Operating System Structure(different approaches)</dt>
    <dd>-There are two different aproaches to a system structure:
     <ul>
      <li>human user to applicatoin software to operating sytem to other system software to hardware</li>
      <li>Human users to operating system to hardware</li>
     </ul>
  <dt>System Boot</dt>
    <dd>-When a computer loads up large programs onto its RAM</dd>
  <dt>CISC vs RISC</dt>
    <dd>-CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) is a computer in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations or are capable of multi-step operations or addresssing modes with single instructions.</dd>
    <dd>-RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is a computer based processor or processors designed to perform a limited set of operations extremely quickly.</dd>
  <dt>Virtual Machine(VM)<dt>
    <dd>-A kind of software that emulates a computer sytem</dd>
  <dt> Kernal Virtual Machine</dt>
    <dd>-A process which seperates the software application and computer hardware to distinct between the two</dd>
