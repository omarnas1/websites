<h1>The Titans</h1>


<p>The Titans were the deities in <a href="https://www.greekmythology.com/">Greek Mytholgoy</a> that preceded the Olympians. They were the children of the primordial deities Uranus (heaven) and Gaea (earth). The Titans included Oceanus, Tethys, Hyperion, Theia, Coeus, Phoebe, Cronus, Rhea, Mnemosyne, Themis, Crius and Iapetus. Cronus was the leader of the Titans, after he managed to overthrow his tyrant father Uranus from the throne. Cronus later learned of a prophecy that said his son would eventually overthrow him and did everything he could to prevent it. However, the prophecy came true and Zeus managed to dethrone him and end the age of the Titans, after the Titanomachy, the great war between Titans and Olympians.</p>
